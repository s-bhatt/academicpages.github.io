This is Shivang Bhatt's home on the web!

I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick with an expected graduation in Spring 2019. I am extremely excited and actively looking for Summer 2018 Internship opportunities in Software Engineering and Technology, where I will get a chance to collaborate with insanely talented people and be a part of high impacting synergistic teams.

Before joining Rutgers University as a graduate student in the Computer Science department, I worked for more than 2 at Indiaâ€™s leading e-Commerce company [Flipkart](www.flipkart.com) as a Software Development Engineer. I had the opportunity to work with extremely talented teams and develop applications at scale. I have the experience of working on a diverse tech stack which includes Java, Python, Spark, SQL, and Cassandra. We were encouraged to proactively solve challenges, help others grow, and create an environment of synergy. For example, the RESTful web services I wrote using an Object-Oriented backend framework in Java were able to serve 1000 API requests per second on business critical paths. Serving close to 10 million requests per day and crunching shards of data are indicative of the scale and complexity of these projects. We used Git SVN and JIRA task management for our code, which we deployed on industry scale UNIX machines. I have also successfully completed my Agile Scrum software development methodology training from the Amsterdam headquartered Xebia Group. 

Currently at Rutgers, I am working as a Student Software Developer at the Laboratory for Computer Science Research (LCSR) in the Computer Science department. I am developing a comprehensive Java application using the Swing and AWT framework for a research project in collaboration with the Boston University. With regards to my academics, I was able to showcase an excellent academic performance having secured a 3.66 GPA in my first semester. I had opted for courses on Algorithms, Operating Systems Design, and Design of Internet Services. This Spring, I am studying Database System Implementation, Software Engineering and Massive Data Mining.

Such relevant experiences have helped me develop strong interpersonal and communication skills. It has also helped me understand the importance of collaboration and teamwork in creating impactful and meaningful projects.
